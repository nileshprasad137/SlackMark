# SlackMark

Bookmark URL's to your slack channel.

This project uses:

- the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/);
- Slack's [incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)
- For client side purpose, I have developed a Chrome Extension available [here](https://github.com/nileshprasad137/slackMark-chromeExtension)
